To test this on live you will need:

1) Python, preferably 2.7, not tested with prior versions.
2) virtualenv

Installation:
a) Create new virtual env anywhere (but better not inside project itself) `virtualenv starter-env`
b) Activate it `source starter-env/bin/activate`
c) Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
d) Run server: `python runserver.py`

Server will be started on localhost:8080 port, to adjust it modify runserver.py

To start creating your own project first read the documentation(which does not exists yet)
So read the code :)
